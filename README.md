# Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
## Conceptual Understanding:
### Onion Architecture: (Yes/No)
#### Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
- Yes, I am familiar with the Onion Architecture idea, which advocates for a layered architectural approach in software design to promote separation of concerns and testability.

### MVC Pattern: (Yes/No)
#### Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
- Yes, I'm familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, which is often used in web application development. The Model represents the data, the View represents the display layer, and the Controller handles the logic and serves as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

### Web API: (Yes/No)
#### Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
- Yes, I understand the notion of implementing RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core Web API, which entails defining endpoints that follow REST principles for sharing data via HTTP.

### Application & Bottlenecks:
### Onion Architecture:
### Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
#### Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
- Onion Architecture provides numerous significant advantages in.NET Core programs. First, its modular form encourages code organization into discrete levels, making maintenance and scalability easier as the project expands. Second, the architecture's emphasis on separation of concerns improves testability by allowing developers to create focused and detailed unit tests for each layer. Third, its flexibility enables independent updates and adjustments within each layer, lowering the danger of unexpected consequences throughout the application. Finally, Onion Architecture promotes clean and structured codebases, resulting in higher overall code quality and developer productivity.

### Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

#### Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
#### MVC:
#### Components: (1-3 keywords each)

#### Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
- In the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design, the Model represents the application's data and business logic, while the Controller handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The View is in charge of presenting user interface elements to users, showing data from the Model, and collecting user input. The Controller serves as a link between the Model and the View, handling user requests, changing the Model based on user input, and selecting the appropriate View to render the result.

### Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

#### Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
#### Web API:
#### Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

#### Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
- Traditional MVC applications are largely concerned with rendering HTML views for display in web browsers, and delivering interactive user interfaces for web apps. Web APIs, on the other hand, are intended for data interchange over HTTP, with the goal of delivering structured data (such as JSON or XML) for client application consumption. Unlike MVC, Web APIs do not focus on rendering views, but rather on exposing endpoints that allow clients to interact with the server and perform resource tasks like as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

### Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
#### Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
